If you want to run it on chrome opening directly from the folder (without a server) you need to do this:

For Windows:

Open the start menu
Type windows+R or open "Run"
Execute the following command:
chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C://Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security


Otherwise, this works best on microsoft edg(opened directly from the folder wihtout a server) or hosted on a server(such as xampp).



How to use:

On the header bar thing, there are three buttons (monochrome,free,analohous) that choose the color scheme. 

"Free" gives you 5 swatches that let you choose any 5 colors you want in the picture.

"Monochrome" lets you choose one color for the picture.

"Analogous" lets you choose one main color (the middle swatch). Choosing colors on the top and bottom swatch are just meant to compare,
they won't actually be used in the picture. After pressing set, the top and bottom swatches will be analogous colors to the one in the middle.



Then, press the SET button on the header bar to change the color of the picture. For the analogous setting, pressing SET will use the middle 
color and then calculate the 2 colors analogous to it (like if you choose blue the other two colors will be green-blue and maybe a darker blue). 
So, whatever was chosen for the top and bottom swatches will be replaced with the new analogous ones. 

You can also hover your mouse over the swatches to see their current color in rgb form/hex form.

Also, analogous doesnt work with black, gray, or white because they aren't hues, they're just shades of lighting, 
that's why they're not on a color wheel.
